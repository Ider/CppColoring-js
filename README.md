# Regular Expression based C++ Syntax Highlight
---

 this project is for posting colorful C++ codes on website, as the color of text for programmers is really meaningful, and I also want the color for the codes would be easily changed.
                    
* All syntax searching and replacing are based on regular expression    
* Using style sheet instead of inline style, so that you can create style for your codes just as you like.  Here is my css file    
* HTML (light) encode would be done before any other matching action, in case the '<' for tags may be encoded    
* (String) Quotes matching would be done before any other styling addtion, in case the '"' for attributes may be matched
